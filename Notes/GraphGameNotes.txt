Summary of inital discussion:
-----------------------------

As a team we met and discussed the future of this project/ research effort. Analyzing the benefits and
 weighing the costs of writing a math research paper VS programming a game. 

Both would be beneficial as any experience is good, however, for the purposes of three computer science 
majors, making the game offers more of a "hands on" project to show in presentations and when applying 
for internships.



Goal for the game:
------------------

1. Take a graph and a set ordering
2. Find how many colors to cover the vertices
3. Display the results



To acheive this:
----------------

1. Begin researching Pygame and getting all dependencies set up correctly
2. Make some simple programs
	- A window opens, color is there and when clicked on it changes
3. Our first iteration of the Graph game will have only one graph to begin with. 
	Once it works, then we can expand.
