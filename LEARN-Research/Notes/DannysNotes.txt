DANNY'S NOTES


Come up with programs that test for the chromatic coloring for various types of graphs
Programs should find the lowest single-player value coloring

Define a function that accepts the input of a graph type and a numerical range
Then generate the lowest k-coloring version of that graph for every graph in that range
